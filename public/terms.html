                    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
                    <h2>Welcome to GetAA.org!</h2>
                    
                    <p>Thanks for using our services.  The services are intended to be provided anonymously from the cloud with no physical address, organization, or person designated as owner.  By using our services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Using our Services</h2>
                    
                    <p>You must follow any policies made available to you within the services.</p>
                    
                    <p>Don&#39;t misuse our services. For example, don&#39;t interfere with our services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.</p>
                    
                    <p>Using our services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our services or the content you access. You may not use content from our services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our services. Don&#39;t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our services.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our services display some content that is not ours. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don&#39;t assume that we do.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some of our services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.</p>                  
                                      
                    <h2>Your GetAA.org Account</h2>
                    
                    <p>You may need a getaa.org account in order to use some of our services.  Accounting of moves, adds, and changes made to the services occurs for quality of services purposes.  Effort is made to keep all accounts and account activity private but no gurantees are made by getaa.org.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Your Content in our Services</h2>
                    
                    <p>Some of our services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.</p>
                    
                    <p>When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our services, you give getaa.org &#40;and those we work with&#41; a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our services. Some services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that service. Also, in some of our services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our services.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
                    
                    <p>We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don&#39;t promise about our Services.</p>
                    
                    <p>OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER GETAA.ORG NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON&#39;T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES &#34;AS IS&#34;.</p>
                    
                    <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON&#45;INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.</p>
